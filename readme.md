# Large Data Set
Experimenting with large data set

This is a project based on the use of technology (programming in this case) to study a large data set, provided by Edexcel as a compulsory piece of large data A-level Maths students need to study throughout the duration of their course from September 2017.

The large data set can be found via the [Edexcel web site](https://qualifications.pearson.com/en/qualifications/edexcel-a-levels/mathematics-2017.coursematerials.html#filterQuery=category:Pearson-UK:Category%2FSpecification-and-sample-assessments)
